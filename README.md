# FLASK-CS-Project-2024
 real CS project 2024 

created 11-23-24 this project is my submission for the advanced computing Princeton day school project. 


important files to check for code are as follows from this directory: 

mytester.py --> has alot of the helper code and information 

flaskr/app.py --> alot of the main routing functions, controls the whole site 

flaskr/templates/entry.html --> this is the main home page, controls the day information and the like 

flaskr/templates/results.html --> this is the template for the results page, also enter information to be encoded and the like 

flaskr/static/data --> this is where all of the data is stored, it is not ment to be human readable as it is fully encrypted. 
each sheet is a separate category, each entry a different interest. 


some other files are important for module routing and backend but no one cares. 

anyway have fun, remember to run in virtual enviorment with all the requirements lists in requirments.txt


make sure in right directory to access app.py and run: 
flask --app app.py run --debug 

by default it runs on port 5000


more information is in specific function file and within website how to use page.
